1. How to convert messages?
  Use Javascript to convert message from source type to destination type in the preprocessor of a Channel.
2. Channels
  we ned 3 channels. One (channel A) for receiving messages from petal, one (channel B) for main code, one (channel C) for sending messages to BBM. By this design, we just need to change A and C to switch to new platforms.
