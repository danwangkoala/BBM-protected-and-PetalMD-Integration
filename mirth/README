MC communicates with the source system via a source connector. Channels define message interfaces to trade
data between systems. Source connectors link to a data source and listen/poll for data. Filters accept/reject
messages based on programmed rules. Transformers manipulate and extract data from messages and can even
create a new outbound message from inbound data. Destination connectors route transformed messages to
destination systems and applications. -- From Mirth Connnect Introduction Document

1. How to convert messages?
  Use Javascript to convert message from source type to destination type in the preprocessor of a Channel.
2. Channels
  we ned 3 channels. One (channel A) for receiving messages from petal, one (channel B) for main code, one (channel C) for sending messages to BBM. By this design, we just need to change A and C to switch to new platforms.
3. Import channels
  In MC, you can just import channels of "Middleware.xml", "PetalReader.xml", and "BBMSender.xml". And "Petal2BBM.xml" is a libraby. So you should import it as a code template.
